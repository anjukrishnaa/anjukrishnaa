Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that significantly affects communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for timely intervention and support. This project explores ASD detection by employing machine learning algorithms on both tabular data and images to create a comprehensive diagnostic tool. Specifically, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) analyzes demographic, clinical, and family history features in tabular data, while a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) identifies physical features associated with ASD in images. The integration of these models allows users to input both data types, offering predictions on the likelihood of ASD and enhancing diagnostic processes for better outcomes.The dual-modality approach leverages the strengths of both the SVM and CNN models, providing a more holistic and accurate diagnostic tool. The SVM effectively identifies ASD-related patterns in structured data, while the CNN model includes convolutional and pooling layers optimized to detect subtle patterns in images. Though the CNN modelâ€™s performance highlights areas for improvement in image-based diagnosis, this project demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of using machine learning for ASD diagnosis. Future work will focus on refining the CNN model and expanding the dataset to enhance diagnostic accuracy, ultimately supporting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improving outcomes for individuals with ASD.
